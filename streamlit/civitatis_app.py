In 2016 they opened their first phisical shop in the centre of Madrid, but their business is mainly based on the internet. They have pursued several marketing campaings including tv and radio advertisements, but the key of their success is that they've managed to settle their brand operating apart from the main rating platforms in tourism business like tripadvisor or yelp.\n\n The company has had a consistent growth untill the covid-19 crisis which forced the whole tourism industry to stop and restart from zero. In the post-covid casecenario, with the travels to and from foreing countries highly restricted, the brand presence among locals has been crucial for recovery.")

On the other hand,\nthe local guide must pay a fixed amount of money for each client that joins the tour\nto the OTA that provides the tourists. Taking on account that the risk for the\ncompanies is nearly zero, it's easy to figure out why this model, created by Chris\nSandemans in 2003, is nowadays followed by tons of companies (just type 'free tour'\non google and enjoy) and has become one of the main battle fields for walking tours\ncompanies.To check if the tourist who booked the activity actually showed up so they\ncan charge the guide (remember that it's free and you might feel in the mood for a\nbeer in stead of walking when the tour begins), civitatis ask the client for\na review. This is a very easy step for the client and he doesn't have to share any\ninformation if he doesn't want to, it works as a check in. If a tourist that was not\nreported by the local guide sends a review, the company will know that the guide is\ncheating... But for what matters to us, this means that the reviews in civitatis are\na trustful source of information regarding how many people joins the tours\nthey promote.")
